//Solution to the Tailwind CSS class issue. Ensures that the styles are applied correctly.
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md w-64 text-center">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Corrected Behavior</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">This text is now correctly gray.</p>
</div>

/* Possible causes and solutions:

1. **Conflicting Styles:** Check for conflicting styles in your CSS or other style sheets that might be overriding the Tailwind classes. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's styles and see if there are any conflicting styles applied.
2. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for any typos in your Tailwind class names. Even a small error can prevent the class from being applied.
3. **Missing or Incorrect PurgeCSS Configuration:** If you are using PurgeCSS to optimize your Tailwind CSS output, make sure it's properly configured to include the classes you're using. If not included, the CSS may not be generated for them.
4. **Order of Classes:** The order of Tailwind CSS classes matters. Make sure that more specific classes are placed after more general classes.
5. **Incorrect Tailwind CSS Setup:** Verify that Tailwind CSS is correctly installed and configured in your project. Follow the official Tailwind CSS installation and configuration instructions carefully.
6. **CSS Specificity:** If your conflicting styles come from more specific selectors, you can use the `!important` flag as a last resort; however, this is generally discouraged because it can lead to hard-to-debug issues later on. Use it with caution!*/
