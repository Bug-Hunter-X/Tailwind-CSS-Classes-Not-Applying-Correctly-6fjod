# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly, leading to unexpected styling results.  The example showcases text that should be gray but instead appears black, highlighting a potential issue with class precedence or conflicting styles.

## Bug Description

A simple div element uses Tailwind CSS classes to style it with a gray background, padding, shadow, rounded corners, a specific width, and text properties.  The text color class `text-gray-700` is not applied, resulting in black text instead of the expected gray.
